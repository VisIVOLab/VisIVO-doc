VisIVO Desktop
-------
VisIVODesktop provides a multi-platform desktop environment for the interactive visualization of cosmological simulations.

VisIVO and Vialactea Science Gateway
-------
The VisIVO Science Gateway aims to create an astrophysical portal based on the generic-purpose gUSE/WS-PGRADE portal family to access VisIVO software tools. It has been developed thanks to the EU FP7 Sci-Bus Project.

The VIALACTEA Science Gateway operates as a central workbench for the VIALACTEA community in order to allow astronomers to process the new-generation surveys (from Infrared to Radio) of the Galactic Plane to build and deliver a quantitative 3D model of our Milky Way Galaxy. The adopted agile software development process allowed to fulfill the community needs in terms of required workflows and underlying resource monitoring. The science gateway has been developed in the context of the EU FP7 VIALACTEA project.  

VisIVO Mobile
-------
The VisIVO Mobile application is connected to a WS-PGRADE/gUSE gateway [4] and accesses to VisIVO Server tools, enabling execution of a comprehensive collection of modules for data exploration (including processing and visualization) of astrophysical datasets on DCIs. A number of customized workflows have been configured by default, e.g. to allow local or remote upload of datasets and creation of scientific movies. These workflows are provided with specific user interfaces to enable easy parameter setting for the end-users while hiding the complexity of the underlying system and infrastructures. The mobile application employs the same user accounts of the SG and provides a platform for astrophysical communities to share results, analysis experiences and exploration of their datasets.
